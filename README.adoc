## Wishes For project

- Added player profiles and saved whole games per player to feed into a Machine Learning Algo to help train the AI on how best to defeat a particular player.

- Added something new to tic-tac-toe gameplay (on last space, the first 3 spaces played become available to prevent tie)

- Come up with better graphic design
